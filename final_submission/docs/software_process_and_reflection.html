<h1>Software Process and Reflection</h1>

<p>Upon being assigned, we noticed that we had an undefined student in our group, and it took a while for that to be sorted out, but with the addition of Kyle to our team we deduced in our Slack group which team member would have which part on a first-come first-serve basis. Then we met up in a library study room to map out some of the biggest challenges we’d have to face, including which team members would have to interact with each other the most, and the overall structure of our system, like quiz variables and accessibility to objects.</p>
<p>A Git repository was set up on GitHub under Kyle’s account in the first days of our group’s lifespan and the most important aspects of our code, like the persistence and object structures, were constantly updated to provide the group members with an easily accessible way to make sure their code would work with others.</p>
<p>We met up afterwards once a week, to discuss how our ends were progressing and what would need to be done for each other’s modules to work properly. As the projects approached their due dates, we did find ourselves communicating less and less and keeping to ourselves, but where the assignments were technically individual, this was not considered a problem.</p>
<p>Eventually, the group modules of Manual Grading, Persistence, and Create Quiz were uploaded to the GIt repository, with the other two members of the group stating they would upload theirs in the coming future. Jon’s Automatic Grading was submitted to Slack, with it being added to the GIt through the members already in the repo, and as of submission, the remaining Take Quiz module has been received as of April 5th, which is the last day this project can be submitted. As a result of this, implementation of this module will most certainly turn out to be less than satisfactory, as we have not received an ample amount of time to implement it into our pre existing code.</p>
<p>As the final days of the project approached, Jack took it upon himself to construct the front-end near single-handedly, based on designs the group had produced and his usage of applications like React and Grommet. To repay this, the other team members were assigned with the documentation processes including the user manual and the group descriptions, with the suggestion to meet up in the engineering building computer lab to finish the project together.</p>
<p>As of submission, Aidan, Jack, John, and Kyle have managed to show up to the computer lab. Whether or not Arsenii had prior commitments, or if he simply decided not to show up is unknown. This indeed shows a fatal flaw in the organization of our group work, which could have been fixed by being more assertive that our members show up to our coding sessions, or a simpler method of submitting code. But at the end the other team members did not see this project as important enough to finish as a team, and that is something worth regretting in retrospect.</p>
