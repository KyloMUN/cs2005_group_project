                                This requirement is also covered in the function 'change_question_grade_for_student'. Since this 
                                requirement is very much similar to the previous requirement, we found it would be easier to have 
                                the requirement be dealt with by the same function that changes the grade, but with an added option to
                                 present a newAnswer you would like to overwrite the current answer with. 
                                If a newAnswer is provided, the fuction will overwrite the current answer with your provided newAnswer.

                                This is covered in the function 'change_answer'. However, instead of editing currently existing quiz answers,
                                 the function instead appends the correct version of the answer to the list of currently correct answers.
                                 This is done to prevent conflicts between students who may have already completed the question and received
                                 a correct mark, but perhaps removing one of the answers would dock them a mark unfairly.

                                    This is done in the 'change_grade' function in the module. The way the grading modules work together prevents 
                                    a sure fire way of changing the grade of an entire class all at once, so changing an entire class' grades would be
                                    done through our react-based quiz system, perhaps by running a list of results through the function multiple times.
                                    But, where this was not deemed necessary, the function takes in a single student's result object and the instructor
                                    can provide them with a newGrade to boost, curve, or decrease their mark accordingly.

                                    Rather than being confined to a single method, the option to leave a note logging your changes is present within

                                    types of notes separate from eachother helps decouple the methods within the module, which helps the entire team.
